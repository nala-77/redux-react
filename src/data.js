        Regardless of the type of grid you are using, the grid is made up
         of three elements: columns, gutters, and margins.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Columns:</b>
         Columns take up mos
        t of the real estate in a grid. Elements and content are plac
        ed in columns. To adapt to any screen size, column widths
         are generally defined wit
        h percentages rather than fixed values and the number of columns will
         vary. For example, a grid on a mobile device mig
        ht have 4 columns and a grid on a desktop might have 12 columns.
        <br/>
        <br/>
         <b>Gutters:</b>
          The gutter is the space between columns that separ
         ates elements and content from different 
         columns. Gutter widths are fixed values but can change
          based on different breakpoints. For example, wider gutters are appropriate for larger screens,

       <p> How you use and set up a grid is fundamental to creating well thought out layouts and experiences for your user.</p>

        <p> <b>Spend time setting up your grid.</b> Take time to think through what type of grid ­— column, modular, or hierarchical — best suits your needs. A hierarchical grid may be the best fit if one item on your page will always be more important than the surrounding elements. For example, hierarchical grids are great for online news platforms. If the content you need to display is highly variable, consider using a basic column or modular grid, as these provide lots of flexibility when designing. 
        For example, elements and content can span across multiple columns or modules or just one to fit design needs.</p>
       <p> <b>Choose the right grid for your needs </b> Once you have figured out what type of grid will work well for your needs, start setting it up. Determine the number of columns and the margin and gutter sizes relative to your screen sizes. You will most likely want to prepare for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. A 12-column grid at laptop or desktop size is generally flexible enough for most design needs. The number of columns will decrease as your device size decreases.
        Wireframing tools like Sketch and Figma have quick and easy ways to set up and edit your grid, even after you have started designing.</p>

        Regardless of the type of grid you are using, the grid is made up
         of three elements: columns, gutters, and margins.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Columns:</b>
         Columns take up mos
        t of the real estate in a grid. Elements and content are plac
        ed in columns. To adapt to any screen size, column widths
         are generally defined wit
        h percentages rather than fixed values and the number of columns will
         vary. For example, a grid on a mobile device mig
        ht have 4 columns and a grid on a desktop might have 12 columns.
        <br/>

         <b>Gutters:</b>
          The gutter is the space between columns that separ
         ates elements and content from different 
         columns. Gutter widths are fixed values but can change
          based on different breakpoints. For example, wider gutters are appropriate for larger screens,

          maller gutters are appropriate for smaller screens like mobile.

       <h3 class="font-bold">Choosing and Setting Up Your Grid </h3> 
       <p> How you use and set up a grid is fundamental to creating well thought out layouts and experiences for your user.</p>

        <p> <b>Spend time setting up your grid.</b> Take time to think through what type of grid ­— column, modular, or hierarchical — best suits your needs. A hierarchical grid may be the best fit if one item on your page will always be more important than the surrounding elements. For example, hierarchical grids are great for online news platforms. If the content you need to display is highly variable, consider using a basic column or modular grid, as these provide lots of flexibility when designing. 
        For example, elements and content can span across multiple columns or modules or just one to fit design needs.</p>
       <p> <b>Choose the right grid for your needs </b> Once you have figured out what type of grid will work well for your needs, start setting it up. Determine the number of columns and the margin and gutter sizes relative to your screen sizes. You will most likely want to prepare for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

       <h3 class="font-bold">Choosing and Setting Up Your Grid </h3> 
       <p> How you use and set up a grid is fundamental to creating well thought out layouts and experiences for your user.</p>

        <p> <b>Spend time setting up your grid.</b> Take time to think through what type of grid ­— column, modular, or hierarchical — best suits your needs. A hierarchical grid may be the best fit if one item on your page will always be more important than the surrounding elements. For example, hierarchical grids are great for online news platforms. If the content you need to display is highly variable, consider using a basic column or modular grid, as these provide lots of flexibility when designing. 
        For example, elements and content can span across multiple columns or modules or just one to fit design needs.</p>
       <p> <b>Choose the right grid for your needs </b> Once you have figured out what type of grid will work well for your needs, start setting it up. Determine the number of columns and the margin and gutter sizes relative to your screen sizes. You will most likely want to prepare for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. A 12-column grid at laptop or desktop size is generally flexible enough for most design needs. The number of columns will decrease as your device size decreases.
        Wireframing tools like Sketch and Figma have quick and easy ways to set up and edit your grid, even after you have started designing.</p>

        <b>Breaking Down the Grid</b>
        <br/>
        Regardless of the type of grid you are using, the grid is made up
         of three elements: columns, gutters, and margins.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Columns:</b>
         Columns take up mos
        t of the real estate in a grid. Elements and content are plac
        ed in columns. To adapt to any screen size, column widths
         are generally defined wit
        h percentages rather than fixed values and the number of columns will
         vary. For example, a grid on a mobile device mig
        ht have 4 columns and a grid on a desktop might have 12 columns.
        <br/>
        <br/>
         <b>Gutters:</b>
          The gutter is the space between columns that separ
         ates elements and content from different 
         columns. Gutter widths are fixed values but can change
          based on different breakpoints. For example, wider gutters are appropriate for larger screens,

       <p> How you use and set up a grid is fundamental to creating well thought out layouts and experiences for your user.</p>

        <p> <b>Spend time setting up your grid.</b> Take time to think through what type of grid ­— column, modular, or hierarchical — best suits your needs. A hierarchical grid may be the best fit if one item on your page will always be more important than the surrounding elements. For example, hierarchical grids are great for online news platforms. If the content you need to display is highly variable, consider using a basic column or modular grid, as these provide lots of flexibility when designing. 
        For example, elements and content can span across multiple columns or modules or just one to fit design needs.</p>
       <p> <b>Choose the right grid for your needs </b> Once you have figured out what type of grid will work well for your needs, start setting it up. Determine the number of columns and the margin and gutter sizes relative to your screen sizes. You will most likely want to prepare for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. A 12-column grid at laptop or desktop size is generally flexible enough for most design needs. The number of columns will decrease as your device size decreases.
        Wireframing tools like Sketch and Figma have quick and easy ways to set up and edit your grid, even after you have started designing.</p>

        Regardless of the type of grid you are using, the grid is made up
         of three elements: columns, gutters, and margins.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Columns:</b>
         Columns take up mos

        ed in columns. To adapt to any screen size, column widths
         are generally defined wit
        h percentages rather than fixed values and the number of columns will
         vary. For example, a grid on a mobile device mig
        ht have 4 columns and a grid on a desktop might have 12 columns.
        <br/>
        <br/>
         <b>Gutters:</b>
          The gutter is the space between columns that separ
         ates elements and content from different 
         columns. Gutter widths are fixed values but can change
          based on different breakpoints. For example, wider gutters are appropriate for larger screens,

       <p> How you use and set up a grid is fundamental to creating well thought out layouts and experiences for your user.</p>

        <p> <b>Spend time setting up your grid.</b> Take time to think through what type of grid ­— column, modular, or hierarchical — best suits your needs. A hierarchical grid may be the best fit if one item on your page will always be more important than the surrounding elements. For example, hierarchical grids are great for online news platforms. If the content you need to display is highly variable, consider using a basic column or modular grid, as these provide lots of flexibility when designing. 
        For example, elements and content can span across multiple columns or modules or just one to fit design needs.</p>
       <p> <b>Choose the right grid for your needs </b> Once you have figured out what type of grid will work well for your needs, start setting it up. Determine the number of columns and the margin and gutter sizes relative to your screen sizes. You will most likely want to prepare for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. A 12-column grid at laptop or desktop size is generally flexible enough for most design needs. The number of columns will decrease as your device size decreases.
        Wireframing tools like Sketch and Figma have quick and easy ways to set up and edit your grid, even after you have started designing.</p>

        <b>Breaking Down the Grid</b>
        <br/>
        Regardless of the type of grid you are using, the grid is made up
         of three elements: columns, gutters, and margins.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Columns:</b>
         Columns take up mos
        t of the real estate in a grid. Elements and content are plac
        ed in columns. To adapt to any screen size, column widths
         are generally defined wit
        h percentages rather than fixed values and the number of columns will
         vary. For example, a grid on a mobile device mig
        ht have 4 columns and a grid on a desktop might have 12 columns.
        <br/>
        <br/>
         <b>Gutters:</b>
          The gutter is the space between columns that separ
         ates elements and content from different 
         columns. Gutter widths are fixed values but can change
          based on different breakpoints. For example, wider gutters are appropriate for larger screens,

       <h3 class="font-bold">Choosing and Setting Up Your Grid </h3> 
       <p> How you use and set up a grid is fundamental to creating well thought out layouts and experiences for your user.</p>

        <p> <b>Spend time setting up your grid.</b> Take time to think through what type of grid ­— column, modular, or hierarchical — best suits your needs. A hierarchical grid may be the best fit if one item on your page will always be more important than the surrounding elements. For example, hierarchical grids are great for online news platforms. If the content you need to display is highly variable, consider using a basic column or modular grid, as these provide lots of flexibility when designing. 
        For example, elements and content can span across multiple columns or modules or just one to fit design needs.</p>
       <p> <b>Choose the right grid for your needs </b> Once you have figured out what type of grid will work well for your needs, start setting it up. Determine the number of columns and the margin and gutter sizes relative to your screen sizes. You will most likely want to prepare for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. A 12-column grid at laptop or desktop size is generally flexible enough for most design needs. The number of columns will decrease as your device size decreases.
        Wireframing tools like Sketch and Figma have quick and easy ways to set up and edit your grid, even after you have started designing.</p>

         are generally defined wit
        h percentages rather than fixed values and the number of columns will

         ates elements and content from different 
         columns. Gutter widths are fixed values but can change
          based on different breakpoints. For example, wider gutters are appropriate for larger screens,

        <p> <b>Spend time setting up your grid.</b> Take time to think through what type of grid ­— column, modular, or hierarchical — best suits your needs. A hierarchical grid may be the best fit if one item on your page will always be more important than the surrounding elements. For example, hierarchical grids are great for online news platforms. If the content you need to display is highly variable, consider using a basic column or modular grid, as these provide lots of flexibility when designing. 
        For example, elements and content can span across multiple columns or modules or just one to fit design needs.</p>
       <p> <b>Choose the right grid for your needs </b> Once you have figured out what type of grid will work well for your needs, start setting it up. Determine the number of columns and the margin and gutter sizes relative to your screen sizes. You will most likely want to prepare for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. A 12-column grid at laptop or desktop size is generally flexible enough for most design needs. The number of columns will decrease as your device size decreases.

        <b>Breaking Down the Grid</b>
        <br/>
        Regardless of the type of grid you are using, the grid is made up
         of three elements: columns, gutters, and margins.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Columns:</b>
         Columns take up mos
        t of the real estate in a grid. Elements and content are plac
        ed in columns. To adapt to any screen size, column widths
         are generally defined wit
        h percentages rather than fixed values and the number of columns will
         vary. For example, a grid on a mobile device mig
        ht have 4 columns and a grid on a desktop might have 12 columns.
        <br/>
        <br/>
         <b>Gutters:</b>
          The gutter is the space between columns that separ
         ates elements and content from different 
         columns. Gutter widths are fixed values but can change
          based on different breakpoints. For example, wider gutters are appropriate for larger screens,

       <p> How you use and set up a grid is fundamental to creating well thought out layouts and experiences for your user.</p>

        <p> <b>Spend time setting up your grid.</b> Take time to think through what type of grid ­— column, modular, or hierarchical — best suits your needs. A hierarchical grid may be the best fit if one item on your page will always be more important than the surrounding elements. For example, hierarchical grids are great for online news platforms. If the content you need to display is highly variable, consider using a basic column or modular grid, as these provide lots of flexibility when designing. 
        For example, elements and content can span across multiple columns or modules or just one to fit design needs.</p>
       <p> <b>Choose the right grid for your needs </b> Once you have figured out what type of grid will work well for your needs, start setting it up. Determine the number of columns and the margin and gutter sizes relative to your screen sizes. You will most likely want to prepare for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. A 12-column grid at laptop or desktop size is generally flexible enough for most design needs. The number of columns will decrease as your device size decreases.
        Wireframing tools like Sketch and Figma have quick and easy ways to set up and edit your grid, even after you have started designing.</p>

        <b>Breaking Down the Grid</b>
        <br/>
        Regardless of the type of grid you are using, the grid is made up
         of three elements: columns, gutters, and margins.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Columns:</b>
         Columns take up mos
        t of the real estate in a grid. Elements and content are plac
        ed in columns. To adapt to any screen size, column widths
         are generally defined wit
        h percentages rather than fixed values and the number of columns will
         vary. For example, a grid on a mobile device mig
        ht have 4 columns and a grid on a desktop might have 12 columns.
        <br/>
        <br/>
         <b>Gutters:</b>
          The gutter is the space between columns that separ
         ates elements and content from different 
         columns. Gutter widths are fixed values but can change
          based on different breakpoints. For example, wider gutters are appropriate for larger screens,

       <h3 class="font-bold">Choosing and Setting Up Your Grid </h3> 
       <p> How you use and set up a grid is fundamental to creating well thought out layouts and experiences for your user.</p>

        <p> <b>Spend time setting up your grid.</b> Take time to think through what type of grid ­— column, modular, or hierarchical — best suits your needs. A hierarchical grid may be the best fit if one item on your page will always be more important than the surrounding elements. For example, hierarchical grids are great for online news platforms. If the content you need to display is highly variable, consider using a basic column or modular grid, as these provide lots of flexibility when designing. 
        For example, elements and content can span across multiple columns or modules or just one to fit design needs.</p>
       <p> <b>Choose the right grid for your needs </b> Once you have figured out what type of grid will work well for your needs, start setting it up. Determine the number of columns and the margin and gutter sizes relative to your screen sizes. You will most likely want to prepare for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. A 12-column grid at laptop or desktop size is generally flexible enough for most design needs. The number of columns will decrease as your device size decreases.
        Wireframing tools like Sketch and Figma have quick and easy ways to set up and edit your grid, even after you have started designing.</p>

         The gutters should remain empty as you place elements on the grid in order to clearly separate and align content and elements.
